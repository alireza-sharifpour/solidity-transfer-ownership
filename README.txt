# HelloWorld Contract

The `HelloWorld` contract is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that demonstrates the basics of smart contract development, including state variables, visibility, functions, and modifiers. The primary purpose of this contract is to manage a greeting text, initially set to "Hello World". It allows the owner of the contract to update this text and transfer ownership of the contract to another account.

## Features

- **Initial Greeting**: The contract is initialized with the greeting text "Hello World".
- **Owner Only Modifications**: Only the owner of the contract can change the greeting text or transfer ownership to another account.
- **View Greeting**: Any user can view the current greeting text.

## Requirements

- Solidity ^0.7.0 <0.9.0
- An Ethereum wallet with some ETH for deployment and transactions (e.g., MetaMask).
- A Solidity development environment or IDE (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).

## Deployment

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up. For beginners, [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a good starting point as it's web-based and does not require additional setup.
2. **Compile Contract**: Compile the `HelloWorld` contract using your development environment. Make sure the Solidity compiler version is compatible.
3. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the contract to your chosen network (Ethereum Mainnet, testnet, or a local blockchain like Ganache). You will need some ETH in your wallet to pay for the gas fees.

## Interacting with the Contract

### Viewing the Greeting

- **Remix / Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Call the `helloWorld()` function to view the current greeting text.

### Changing the Greeting

- **Only by Owner**: The `setText(string calldata newText)` function allows the contract owner to change the greeting. This action requires a transaction and gas fees.

### Transferring Ownership

- **Only by Owner**: The `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` function allows the current owner to transfer ownership of the contract to another address.

## Security Features

- **Ownership Check**: The contract includes an `onlyOwner` modifier that restricts certain functions (changing the greeting and transferring ownership) to the current owner of the contract only.
